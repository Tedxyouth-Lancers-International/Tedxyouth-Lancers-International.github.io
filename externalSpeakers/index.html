      <p>A journalist in the making, a thinker in the waking. I oscillate between India and the US but currently the pendulum has made a stop at Gurugram (no idea why you would go from Gurgaon to that). When I'm not crunching words for air or for publication, I can be spotted scribbling in a notebook somewhere in a park, or listening to the likes of Lorde and Rihanna. 
I also have a fondness for reading and writing poetry but I won't bore you with any of it (or would I?). I don't think I can share much wisdom with you considering I'm not old and wise yet but I can surely share some experiences. When I was in the ninth grade no one had heard of a smart phone but today some of you are glancing or sneakily glancing at it as we speak. And lastly, I have two truths and a lie for you: 1) I am a hot yoga enthusiast- meaning I like to kill myself while doing yoga in a 40 degrees heated room 2) I have met Anderson Cooper 3) I used to have hair that reached my waist. Happy guessing!
