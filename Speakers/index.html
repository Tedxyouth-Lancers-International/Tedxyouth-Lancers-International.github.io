      <p>As a sixteen-year-old student and entrepreneur, she is passionate about technology, reading and entrepreneurship. She runs two ventures- BookBiteand Capable. BookBite stemmed from her love of reading. Capable, on the other hand, was born out of a startling realisation she had when she was taking part in a marathon in 2015. Both of these ventures have led her to work towards a very personal goal of inspiring people of all ages and backgrounds to have the same enthusiasm for the things she is passionate about. To this effect, she spends a lot of her free time finding avenues to talk about and share her learnings in these areas.
</p>
<p>The central theme of the talk is to highlight the honest dilemma of choosing to enter the workforce as opposed to enrolling in a college from the perspective of a young demographic most affected by this idea. The aim is to explore the correlation, or the lack thereof, between successful careers and a college education in our country. The vision is to spark a dialogue, internally in the minds of people and externally in groups, in order to bring more clarity about colleges and careers. Her aim is to help people shed the misconception  that the absence of a great college degree will hinder a successful career; at the same time to prevent the false comforting notion that a great college degree will guarantee success.</p>

      <p>A journalist in the making, a thinker in the waking. I oscillate between India and the US but currently the pendulum has made a stop at Gurugram (no idea why you would go from Gurgaon to that). When I'm not crunching words for air or for publication, I can be spotted scribbling in a notebook somewhere in a park, or listening to the likes of Lorde and Rihanna. 
I also have a fondness for reading and writing poetry but I won't bore you with any of it (or would I?). I don't think I can share much wisdom with you considering I'm not old and wise yet but I can surely share some experiences. When I was in the ninth grade no one had heard of a smart phone but today some of you are glancing or sneakily glancing at it as we speak. And lastly, I have two truths and a lie for you: 1) I am a hot yoga enthusiast- meaning I like to kill myself while doing yoga in a 40 degrees heated room 2) I have met Anderson Cooper 3) I used to have hair that reached my waist. Happy guessing!

<p>
Dr.Vimersh Raina was born and brought up in Kashmir. He received his specialization (MD) in Pathology from Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana (Punjab) in 1995. He strongly believes that the field of medical sciences is one which goes through cases of extreme dynamics and undergoes constant transformation. Therefore, he advocates that clinical application of medical knowledge needs to start considering the changes in societal needs and demands. He is also the Founding Mentor of Genebandhu–a Non Profit Organizations engaged in the field of mustering community support towards enhancing the standard of care available for Thalassemia and Leukaemia patients across India.</p>
<p><b>Genebandhu - A step to prevent the gradual demolition of a positive society</b></p>
<p>People nowadays are becoming increasingly self-centred and self-obsessed. We don't help people in need. Dr.Vimersh, therefore, believes in an ideology based on our ancient saying: "Vasudev Kutumbakam", which means that we are all one family. Once we start to consider everybody as part of our family, the major issues around us will start resolving peacefully on their own.</p>

<p><b>The Butterfly Effect</b></p><p>
"The Butterfly Effect”, first proposed by Edward Lorenz to map the weather, is a simple philosophy that every step taken in this world starts a domino effect in its own regard. It is simply scientific evidence to prove the fact that nothing that ever happens is irrelevant- it could lead to unimaginable consequences. There are many lessons from history to learn in this regard- How did a sandwich lead to the two world wars? How did a bunch of clouds lead to the atomic bombing of Nagasaki? And how are solar storms and sperm whales connected? It is hard to place faith in a theory sounding so far-fetched; but then again, this will be a speech about taking the plunge.

By the time he turned 13, his gaming skills helped him earn a little pocket money.  He plans to change his audience's perspective towards gaming because he believes that we can gain leverage from our passions and even make a living from them!
</p>
<p>
 In our generation, whenever somebody talks about gaming, it is assumed that the person is a complete failure or wastes his time. However, we are blessed to be born in a time where it is possible to make a living by doing things we are passionate about.

      <p>Archana Garg, 17, an IBDP student at Lancers International School, has an immense passion for languages. She believes that language is the only medium through which a person can express their personal thoughts. She is quite unique from the rest in terms of what she thinks about her culture and language. Due to this, she has chosen Hindi literature, instead of the mainstream English literature, in her IB course. In her opinion, millennials in India  are drifting away from their native language and  their culture, in this era of rapid globalization. She strongly believes that it is essential to stay connected to one's ancestral roots in order to save the bond we share; a bond that connects us through history, ethnicity and values.
</p>
<p><b>Globalization versus sticking to one's own culture? How do they work together, especially in today's world?</b></p><p>
 In the era of technological advancements, it becomes very important not to lose one's cultural identity for it is what always reminds us of our morals and ethics. Should one neglect one's own mother tongue and drift away to a more westernized culture? There are several western ethics and ideas that have impacted  our society, from the food we eat to the way we dress.We often neglect the importance of our culture and heritage; therefore, the talk includes breaking the misconception that learning English is the only way to succeed in life.</p>
